# Food Delivery Application

## Project Overview

The **Food Delivery Application** is a full-stack app designed to facilitate online food ordering. The app features a user-friendly interface, secure authentication, and smooth interaction between the frontend, backend, and database. It is built with the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Google OAuth for secure login

This app allows users to browse available restaurants, select food items, and place orders, all within a responsive and intuitive UI.

## Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
- Secure user registration and login with JWT-based authentication.
- Google OAuth integration for Single Sign-On (SSO) for easy account creation and login.

### 2. **Food Catalog**
- Displays a variety of food items from different restaurants.
- Users can search, filter, and view food categories.

### 3. **Order Placement**
- Users can add food items to the cart and place orders with customization options (size, quantity, etc.).

### 4. **Admin Dashboard**
- An **Admin Dashboard** is provided for restaurant management, where admins can add, update, and delete food items and manage orders.
- Admins can view user activity, order history, and generate reports for data analysis.
